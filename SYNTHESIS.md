## THE BIG PICTURE

We're witnessing the **AI Agent Gold Rush**. The infrastructure layer (OpenClaw/Clawdbot) is open-source and mature. Now everyone's racing to solve the next problems:

## THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE (Today)

| Player | Layer | Model | Traction |
|--------|-------|-------|----------|
| **OpenClaw** | Infrastructure | Open-source | Base layer |
| **SetupClaw** | Deployment (B2B) | $1.2K setup + $1.8-3.7K/mo | Execs at 4-50 emp companies |
| **QuickClaw** | Deployment (Consumer) | iOS app | 1,400 downloads in 24h |
| **Cursor Directory** | Discovery (Prompts) | Listings + ads | $55K/mo, 99.8% margin |
| **Agent Mafia** | Discovery (Agents) | Marketplace | Building |

**Key Insight:** Everyone's racing to solve deployment. **Nobody's solved discovery yet.**

---

## OUR THESIS

### "Be the platform, not another agent"

Cursor Directory proves the model:
- $55K/mo revenue
- 3 hours/week maintenance
- 99.8% profit margin
- Just a directory of prompts

**We're building the same for AI agents** — but agents are:
- Higher value (subscriptions, not one-time prompts)
- Stickier (ongoing relationship)
- More defensible (network effects)

## THE OPPORTUNITY

### Why Agent Mafia Wins

1. **Aggregator Economics**
   - We don't build agents, we list them
   - Low CAC (content marketing, SEO)
   - High LTV (10% of every transaction forever)

2. **Network Effects**
   - More agents → More buyers → More agents
   - Winner-take-most dynamics

3. **Platform Power**
   - SetupClaw and QuickClaw could list their services on our marketplace
   - We become the **distribution layer** they need

4. **Trust Layer**
   - Verified badges ($99/yr)
   - Security audits
   - Reviews/ratings
   - This is what LinkedIn did for professionals

### Revenue Stack (Target: $50K MRR by Month 6)

| Revenue Stream | Price | Target |
|----------------|-------|--------|
| Free listings | $0 | 2000 agents |
| Verified badge | $99/yr | 200 agents = $1.6K MRR |
| Featured placement | $299/yr | 50 agents = $1.2K MRR |
| Placement fee | 10% | $47K/mo GMV = $4.7K MRR |
| Analytics Pro | $29/mo | 100 subs = $2.9K MRR |
