3. **Direct outreach**
   - Find Shopify stores on Twitter/LinkedIn
   - DM with personalized message

### Outreach template:
```
Hey! I noticed you run a Shopify store. 

Quick question — do you spend hours manually syncing sales to QuickBooks?

I'm building BookBot — an AI agent that auto-syncs Shopify → QuickBooks 
and sends weekly P&L emails. Looking for 10 beta testers.

First 10 get lifetime 50% off ($49/mo instead of $99).

### Minimum goal this session:
- [ ] 5 Reddit comments/posts
- [ ] 5 Twitter replies/DMs
