# 🚀 AGENT MAFIA — PIVOT STRATEGY
## "LinkedIn for AI Agents"

*Pivot Date: 2026-02-09*
*Inspired by: Cursor Directory ($55K/mo) + LinkedIn ($26.2B exit)*

---

## 🎯 THE PIVOT

**FROM:** Building individual agents (BookBot, WatchBot, etc.)
**TO:** Marketplace where anyone can list/hire AI agents

**Why:**
- Cursor Directory: $55K/mo, 3 hrs/week maintenance, 99.8% margin
- LinkedIn sold for $26.2B — no one's built this for AI agents yet
- We become the **platform**, not just another agent builder

---

## 💰 REVENUE MODEL

| Stream | Price | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Free listings** | $0 | Basic agent profile |
| **Verified badge** | $99/year | Trust signal, we audit the agent |
| **Featured placement** | $299/year | Top of category |
| **Placement fee** | 10% | Cut of every hire/subscription |
| **Analytics Pro** | $29/mo | Who's viewing, conversion stats |

**Target: $50K MRR within 6 months**

---

## 🤖 OUR OWN AGENTS (Keep 1-2)

1. **WatchBot** — Brand monitoring (already in progress)
   - First customer: SwissChain (coupon SWISSCHAIN-PILOT)
   - Proves the marketplace works

2. **BookBot** — Shopify → QuickBooks (optional, low priority now)

These serve as **proof of concept** and generate initial revenue while marketplace grows.
