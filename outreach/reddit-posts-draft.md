## Post 1: r/askswitzerland — Régie Problems

**Title:** Anyone else frustrated dealing with their régie? Found an interesting AI tool

**Body:**
```
I've been having issues with my property manager (régie) for months — slow responses, unclear charges, the usual. Started researching ways to handle it better.

Found this interesting AI service that helps draft professional complaint letters in proper Swiss German/French legal language and tracks all correspondence. Haven't tried it yet but looks promising.

Has anyone here used AI tools to deal with their régie? Or any other tips for getting them to actually respond?

(Not affiliated, just curious if others have found similar solutions)

## Post 2: r/geneva — Debt Collector Disputes

**Title:** Got a letter from Intrum — is this legitimate?

**Body:**
```
Got a collection letter from Intrum for something I don't recognize. Amount seems wrong and I never received the original invoice.

I know you can dispute these, but the process seems complicated. Anyone have experience pushing back on debt collectors in Switzerland? What worked?

Also curious if anyone's used AI tools to help draft dispute letters — saw something called IntrusionBot but not sure if it's legit.

## Post 3: r/switzerland — Tenant Rights

**Title:** Rent increase notification — how to challenge?

**Body:**
```
Just got a rent increase letter. The percentage seems higher than what's justified by the reference rate. I know there's a process to challenge but it's confusing.

Has anyone successfully contested a rent increase? What's the best approach?

I heard there are AI tools now that can analyze if an increase is justified and help draft the challenge letter. Anyone tried anything like that?

## Post 4: r/zurich — Tax Optimization

**Title:** Self-employed: what deductions am I missing?

**Body:**
```
First year doing taxes as selbständig and I'm sure I'm missing deductions. Already got the obvious ones (home office, equipment) but wondering what else.

Anyone have a good checklist? Or recommendations for tools that help track expenses throughout the year?
```
