Title: I'm building "LinkedIn for AI Agents" — here's why

Everyone's building AI agents, but there's no way to find them.

I'm creating a marketplace where:
- Businesses post "Agent Wanted" listings (pain points)
- Builders submit their agents
- We match supply & demand

Think Upwork but for AI agents, not humans.

Currently have 20 "Agent Wanted" listings ready. Looking for:
1. Agent builders who want free early listings
2. Businesses who want to join waitlists

Would you use this? What's missing?

agentmafia.one
```

**Post 2 (r/smallbusiness):**
```
Title: Who else spends 5+ hours/week on manual bookkeeping?

I'm researching pain points for a new project. 

Specifically: manually syncing Shopify sales to QuickBooks.

- How much time do you spend on this?
- Would you pay $50-100/mo to automate it completely?

Building a directory of AI agents that solve specific business pains.

Subject: Story idea: "LinkedIn for AI agents" marketplace

Hi [Name],

Quick pitch: I'm building a marketplace where businesses post "Agent Wanted" listings and AI builders submit their agents.

Think Upwork for AI agents.

Interesting angles:
- Cursor Directory makes $55K/mo as just a directory
- LinkedIn sold for $26B — what's the AI agent equivalent worth?
- 20 "pain point" listings already live

Would this fit your newsletter? Happy to share early access or do an interview.
