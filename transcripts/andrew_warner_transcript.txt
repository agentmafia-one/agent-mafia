 I'm in, I'm in about seven million ARR. Roughly like where's profit right now? I keep three or something like that. How many people on the team? You're talking to the whole team. What's your process and how are you using Cloud Code now? Hey, Cloud Code. You see that feature in the code over there? Write the document about it and put it on Intercom. I love Cloud Code. I love it. Hey, everyone. I've got a problem here. I'm doing a set of interviews with entrepreneurs about how to build AI companies. And truthfully, I don't see that there are a lot of role models. Most people are just in the look at what I can build mode. Very few are in look at what I can build. And a lot of people are buying it. Now let's sit in for an hour and talk about how we got here so that the rest of the people who are listening can get there. Well, today I've got one of the few examples of what's possible. And I want to learn from him. Josh Moore created Wave AI. It's an audio note taking app. It basically records what you say in meetings or just directly on your phone to yourself. And when I say meetings, I mean in person or offline. And even on phone calls. And I want to understand how he built it to where it is. The next note. Thanks. Presented by Zapier, the AI automation company. Josh, where is it now? What's the revenue today? That's what you're opening with? How about you got to butter me up a little bit? I complimented doing a shirt style before we got started. That's it. I know. That's true. Well, so I'm in about 7 million ARR. I've been flat there for a few months. But it adds a very healthy user base. Yeah, and I'd love to tell you more about it. You've always said, or you've said for a long time, that it's profitable. How profitable and how many people on the team and what goes into putting this together? You're talking to the whole team. There have been some people that have come in and out over the course of the now three years to help with some higher end engineering work, some of the marketing stuff. But by and large, I've done all the engineering. I do all the support, if you chat in app with support, it's me. Yeah, it's a bit of what's the natural limit of what I can do alone. And that's in many ways always is sort of like how I am. That's always been the way I am. But AI is just kind of super charged that. It's allowed me to lean into my worst instincts about just sort of doing it all myself, which is kind of my natural way. I'm surprised because you had worked at Uber and you'd worked so well with so many other people. You don't seem like someone who works alone. I joined Uber at the end of 2011 as the New York General Manager. When the company is small, you can have an outsize impact. I was always attracted to that sort of thing. Basically, I found myself at the end of 2022 without a job sort of in like many of retirement. And chat GPT rolled out and obviously everyone was there and tried it out and like had their mind blown. But for me, my first instinct was like, this can help me sort of achieve a goal of mine which was to become an engineer. I really felt like even in those days before it, like at Uber and more so in the startups before that, I felt like the engineer's kind of had all the power and that'll sound funny because they typically don't within an organization. But if you're selling something that is on the internet, that people that do the engineering work are building the thing that the users use that people see. So I can just remember like having ideas but being limited in what I could do with them because it would require engineers to kind of step in and do it. At levels, which was a health tech startup that I was part of for a couple of years, most like basically the thing I did right before this. Also, you know, like an early stage thing and to get things done, I had to learn React Native. And by learning React Native, I mean like become basically be able to like change text and React Native. Like very minor things, but that was how I did my foot in. Like, oh, this is kind of fun. You know, like I mentioned, I studied math. I'm in, I'm like an analytical guy. So none of this stuff is super foreign, but I never made software that other people used. And so, ChatGPT kind of opened the door of like, oh, you know, I'm 70% of the way there. I have the structure in my head. I kind of understand how computers work. So ChatGPT kind of let me do that and not, you know, like integrated into any system just like the chat window like, hey, I'm making the software. Can you like help me? And so it started helping me. And, you know, so that was September, that was November of 22. I had a few ideas. I kind of rift on them over that over those few months. Let me pause for a moment on there because I don't think I've seen the ideas or understood the framework that you used to pick the ideas that you would pursue. I just heard that you had a bunch of little ideas and wave AI was one of them. What are they and how did you figure out what the ideas would be? Sure. So I mean, none of it was sort of like, I'm going to start a business. It was all just kind of like, I'm unemployed and have free time. And like, this is really fun. But kind of right away, ChatGPT's, you know, the sort of like most amazing thing that it could do in my view was summarize things. So if you think about it up until then, computers, and I've always loved them, the one thing they couldn't really do is summarize text, take a bunch of texts and make it a small amount of text. Like, that struck me as the killer app. And in a lot of ways, it still kind of is. Like, it really is amazing. We're totally used to it now. It's been three and a half years. It's part of our like day to day. But that is still pretty amazing that an LLN can read a bunch of texts and make it a small enough. So one of the ideas was sort of like a two hop. Like record audio, transcribed that into text, which computers were already able to do at that point. And then take that text and summarize it. And the idea was sort of like, you're at lunch with a friend and you talk about all these great things. And like, but then you forget. That's the idea you ended up pursuing. What are some of the other ones that you didn't? I'm trying to understand how you figured out what to do or what to play with. Yeah, I mean, that was the one that ended up being the thing. I had another demo that I built that I'm actually have like revisited and I could tell you about why, but that would basically take New York State legislation from their API and you know the sort of idea like, no one reads the bill. Like the bill comes out and it's too many pages and it's too confusing and there's too many bills. So nobody reads the bill. You know, I got involved in government at Uber. You know, I wouldn't say that I was interested in it, but it was interested in me. And so I had to get sort of into the weeds on that stuff. And AI feels like a good way to make sure that everybody reads the bill. And the things can't be released in the middle of the night and then voted on the next day. Like, so I made this thing that would take every bill coming off the New York State Senate feed and summarize it and do some other things like ask it, who's going to care about this, who was likely to support it, who's likely to oppose it, things like this. And so there's an idea there that I worked on with a buddy from Uber that we actually have revisited. And like I just said, I'll circle back on that and kind of explain why, but we're going to be releasing that as like a stag quest in the next few weeks. So that was one idea. I feel like customer service is sort of an obvious place for this technology to work. And I had a demo back then for like Shopify sellers to sort of because that's like a standardized system. It was way too early and frankly, I still don't think it's a solved. I still don't think that AI has kind of solved that. And I still do all my support by hand, although I am building out something to kind of help with that automatically. But those were kind of the three things. You know, I had an idea. I have a bunch of friends that were on like a chat thread that goes back years and I thought it would be cool to have an AI kind of sit on top of that. And you know, what did Dave say about that thing? At some point in the last five years, like AI would be good at that. So I played with that a little bit. But they were all just like demos for fun to kind of show off what I could do. Like I didn't really think what became Wave would be a standalone business. In fact, I got a lot of advice of like, well, you know, you should focus on a certain vertical. Like wave for doctors or wave for construction. I would think that would make sense too, Josh, because look, when you had launched it, Otter had already been out. Fireflies was out. In fact, Otter, I remember using it as an in-person meeting recorder and it worked really well. And I would imagine that with all these different tools that were out, grain, I think Fathom was out, Reed, who's founder I interviewed recently. Anyway, they were out. And I keep thinking why doesn't one of them focus on a specific industry? Why didn't you? And why did you decide to continue when there were so many already out there? Yeah, I mean Otter does, well, they all sort of started as meeting bots. I'm not sure which of the ones you just mentioned do the generic recording. That's like 90% of my volume. Oh, really? Yeah. So I'll do like 9,000 hours a day. I've just generic audio. And then... Meeting of a person using the voice recorder and talking directly into it. In a meeting. They're using the voice recorder. They might just have it on their desk on a Zoom. Like they might be on a Zoom on their computer and then have the phone on their desk like selfie recording the Zoom. Or it might be in a room, a live meeting. It could be a church. It could be at the doctor's office. There have been, I've seen a bunch of crazy things. But that's, but like most of it is the generic recording audio in physical space I like to call it. Whether that audio is generated from a computer or not, I don't know. But then I also have like meeting bots and phone call recording over a VoIP and things like, and like file imports and things like that. So I'm trying to capture all the different modes, but it is mostly just that first thing. I see. I see. And there are many now, but actually there weren't that many when I started. There were not that many like AI note taking apps in the app store when I launched. Like maybe Otter was there. Well, they were certainly there. I'm not sure if they were meeting bots or regular. But you know, another issue is that I think, I don't know if this is still the thing, but I heard a lot in the beginning that like waves, summaries are better. And I sort of into it, and that Otter might have been not using the best models for their summaries. And for the transcription, one of the things I've tried to focus on is just use the best version of the AI. So like whisper two, whisper three, assembly AI, deep gram. I've tried them all. And I'm just, you know, I'm not afraid to spend them. I was not initially afraid to spend the money to make sure that the quality of the output was the best it could be. I think that I sort of figured it's okay. I'd rather spend more on that. I'm not spending any money on people. So I'd rather really spend it on the AI, make the product as good as possible. And I think really what has made it successful, you know, a bunch of things have, but really the stubborn and relentless just polishing of the product, you know, getting feedback, incorporating it, pushing out a new version. Like I have been working on this full time for years. And so I'm just like, I want it to be perfect. I do sense that like even the fact that you continue to get to do customer support on your own is amazing. Let me pause though for a second. And I want to shift in a moment into the development process. But if I'm understanding you right, you said, look, there's a use case that no one else is doing. Or if they are, they're not doing it to the level that I think they should. And that is recording in person conversations. I want to be there and I want to summarize it. You got it into that. How did you know that you were on the right track? Was it number of users? I know you got traction early. What was it that told you this is worth spending the next few years of my life obsessing on? I don't remember the actual answer, but the answer I give when I ask that is a lesson I learned at Uber, which is if someone on the support line is like exhibiting extreme emotion, whether it's positive emotion or negative emotion, that is actually a good indicator that you're onto something. Like if you can make a customer so mad that you think they want to murder you, you might be onto something there. I remember at Uber, we got a lot of that in the early days, both ecstatic happiness and you know, serious rage. The driver took a left on Fifth Avenue and it wasted 20 minutes and I'm going to kill you. It's like, all right. We are, if you're that passionate, positive or negative about something, then that product has really hit. That's really, there's value there. And so I think part of it was talking to users, you know, I still get a like, this is amazing. You know, for many users, if you're out of the bubble, you're touching AI maybe not that often. Chatchubt once in a while, but you don't really know how to use it for your work. You're not in the bubble. And so this for many of my users I think is their AI. It's what they use AI for. Do you use AI in your life? Yes, I use Wave. Like I like to ask folks in my secular life in my like, not heck life if they use AI yet. And you'd be surprised how many people say no. You know, yeah, for fun on the side, but never for my work. My office doesn't like it. We're not allowed to use it yet, et cetera. Okay. That's most people. So I think going vertical specific is like, is totally crazy. I mean, all my competitors should go ahead and do that. But I think that it makes more sense to be kind of general for this. Like Uber isn't rides first to the use case. It's just rides, but they're not 50 different car sharing companies on the road. And so they don't need to if there were there were though, yeah, there were though. I see there were there were a lot of rideshare apps. I mean, we've had, you know, I can name five that you've never heard of that felt like existential threats to us in the beginning. So it does start out that way. And look, it's not exactly apples to oranges because it is just an app. And there's a lot of clones. I mean, there's probably like 50 of them now. So it's not quite the same. But if it works, it works. All right. So let's get into, I want to cover a couple of things here. One is how you build and especially how it evolved over time. And then also how you market, because I think your promotion is really interesting. You've talked a little bit about meta and obviously, if you need to talk publicly and that's gotten people used. But let's go into building. In the beginning, it was you coding like an amateur developer, but where you where where some people might Google things or go to Stack Overflow, you would go to chat GPT. It was like your your mentor. How do you talk about that? Yeah, I don't know. And Stack Overflow. For sure. Doing it more of the old fashioned way. Like I coded the first version, I did I wrote all the code, you know, because I was able, you know, and I used the AI to like, well, be like a good example. Like that round audio recording. So like someone's recording and then they close it. And then they like minimize the app. Of course, it should still work. Why is it working? It's like, oh, you need to do XYZ. And so there were things like that where it wouldn't necessarily be like, here's the code. What's the problem with it? It might just be like a conceptual question. You know, a lot of the early days was me making a version, trying it out, finding a problem with it, and then working to fix the problem. And then that times a thousand. You know, the whole idea of a server, I sort of was able to sort of into it. Like, oh, I do the recording and then it sends out the file and it waits for the response. But if I close the app in the intro and it's all lost, like, oh, that's what a server is for. That's what a server client, you know, that I should move all this to the server. Like the mobile app should be essentially a recorder. And as soon as the audio is done, it should be uploaded immediately to my server from which all the AI stuff will happen and then return the data back to the phone so that if they go and do something else, it does take a couple minutes to, you know, to process like a one hour thing, it'll be there when they come back. Then the, that's notifications, send them an email, like all the stuff. So I sort of was able to intuit a lot of things that may be in a more formal situation. Someone would learn on the job and learn how like the company does it. I sort of intuited and like got to these things sort of on my own through the experience. But it was very much like have the IDE on one side of my screen have an LLM on the other, bring it over, hey, what's this? Okay, bring it back over like a lot of, a lot of that kind of thing. Battling with the context windows, which were extremely small at that time. So like I really started doing this V1 of like LLMs and all this and have been able to ride those improvements for three years, every month my mind is blown by the newest thing. Like Opus 4.5 and everyone, everyone of my friends who I tell this about, who's not directly involved, is just like you sound like a broken record, you always say that. But I always mean it. Like Opus 4.5 is a departure from the past. It is meaningfully better. It is blowing my mind. Like it's doing things that I can't believe how much it could do on its own now. And so how are you using it? So Josh it blows my mind too. I've never been a developer. I always in the back of my mind like you thought it'd be fun to be able to or at least to understand what other people are doing. I started playing with Cloud Code and I go, can you make this and it's building it for me and it's asking me questions that helped me guide in the right direction and by the end of it. I love Cloud Code. I love it. So crazy is I only started using it two weeks ago. I was sort of like, Cloud Code is like, it's a little two hands off. I don't totally get it. I was aware of it. I was like, I don't really get it. It's writing and you want to write yourself is what I'm understanding about you. No, I don't write, when I write before that I was coming from an IDE like Windsor or whatever. And it was still writing for me, but I was a little more hands. I was watching it. I was seeing the dips, which you can actually still do. But I just didn't get there. Like, I'm old. Like things take a minute for me to want to do. I'm not always about the latest and greatest. I like my way. But I got to it and now it's like all I do in Cloud Code, I bought a Mac mini over the weekend for my bot, and just call that stuff. Like I am deep in it. But I love, the latest and greatest changes so fast that who knows what it'll be by the time someone listens. But yeah, that is what I use now, almost exclusively. How, like, how do you shift from one to the other? What's your process and how are you using Cloud Code now? What's your setup in it? Well, the same underlying model. I'm still using Ocas, but I think, odd, you know, one of the things is you can buy the API by the month with that. So I spend 200 bucks, and I think I get something like $3,000 with a API usage from it, versus going direct and using the API spending $50 to $100 a day, which I'm happy to do. I'm getting serious value out of it, but I'd rather spend less money when I can. But also the agentic loops that it's put in, the way it does the model. The model is the same, but the way it interprets and asks questions and does follow up and touches your files and your file system and bash and all this stuff is like really crazy. Just every day I'm having these experiences that blow my mind, and I'm running out of folks to tell about it, but it's like I was talking about, I like initiated a discussion about my rates. Like how much do I charge? Should I charge less? Like Uber was very big about like time to cut prices. Like we were every six months, we were lowering the price because that's a moat, you know, it makes people, you don't want to get undercut, and I have no costs, and my margins are really good. And so I'd rather get some of that back. So I started like a discussion like let's talk about this. Maybe I divide the features up and put one of them under a lower tier and I was like, let me just go look at your analytics for a bit. I need the API key, I'm like here's my, here's the API key. And it's just like, okay, cool. And it went away for a few minutes. It came back with just like a report that an analyst would spend a week on. And I've like heard people talk about this, but until you experience it, it's crazy. So like, it's nuts, it's nuts. I talked with Ryan Carson. He's got a cron job that just tells it, that goes out every day, does the research on his different analytics and makes recommendations based on what he's done and what's going on in the site. Do you have anything like that that you're doing now or is it too early for you? Ryan Carson is Twitter, right, his Twitter is Ryan Carson. It was hacked recently, but it was hacked. So that was about to say, it was hacked. I got to get GM from him and they'd know since. I'm like, oh, that's why. Yeah. Okay, I did that name. Yeah, I mean, sorry, what was the question? I just like how he had a report every day with recommendations based on his analytics of what he should be doing to change marketing. Yeah, and I'm not as tapped at. I have not built my world around that yet. I'm a messy guy in real life. And I'm a messy guy on the computer. And digitally, and I think having a sort of base level of organization is important. So my like, I have like 50 windows open with different things going on, but yes, with some organization, a buddy like an AI skeptic buddy was like, you bought a Mac mini for all this stuff. Like, this is so stupid. Like, I'm trying to go see this show. Have it monitor the price on stub hub and SeekGeek and all the different places and then send me an email every hour with like, with like all the price of it. And like, perfect, I can do that. To be five minutes, I set it up. It said to me an email every hour. Like, you need to have good ideas like that to sort of do. And I'm just not we're gonna, I keep it all up here. But I'm, but I hope to do more things like that. Like really use them like employees. You know, something, you know, like reading server logs, like searching and reading server logs is like such a great thing like, hey, I had this fire based function called whatever. And it spits out thousands of lines a day. But, you know, lately I've been having these failures. Will you please go and inspect the logs on the terminal? Search the logs, search for the word fatal and write a report and bring it back. And like, you can't eat something if I had been it said, it was like extraordinarily useful that I could not have done on my own. It just, I would have to like dump a million rows and fuck to the, you know, it's just what I did. I, I, I huge pain. So I, I hope to do more things like that. I keep my new feature schedule pretty aggressive. So I like tend to just be looking forward and not spending much time on that stuff. But I, but I should things get this when you're single, when you're like solo founder, things get missed for sure. Would you tell me some of the tools that you're using to put it together? Like, what are some of the, what are some of the software that you rely on to build wave? Her sir is sort of home base for, for like all the code. I have the app repo, but also the web app repo. And then I have sort of like a bunch of other repos that each are sort of web apps themselves that do specific things. So like, I have a couple of side things like wave pod. I'm putting the URLs in the chat wave tube. These are sort of like SEO ideas. Those are, those are, those I'll get to actually around marketing because I was wondering how much, how many new users were coming in. But I saw a really good case study about you on adapt. And so I, I recognize that you're using that, for example, how are you using adapt? How are you using Twilio? What are some of the other tools that you're using? Sure. Adaptie, it's like my source is my sort of central system for all things subscription. So when you buy in the app or on Stripe, it kind of runs through them. Okay. Hey, walls, if I want to run like a test on, you know, like an A, B and all this, that all runs through adaptie. Yeah, I'm a favorite of like, let me write about you as an advertisement. You're so good at that. I get, I get zero new users from that stuff. But anyway, but it's all good. Olio is, um, is for like phone. So that's what the voice over IP. So you can actually like make a phone call in the app. I don't know if you got your own dialer. You check to make sure my phone number is the right one and by validating it. Yeah. Once you know it is, I can dial using your dialer. Yeah. And you call out, they see my number on caller ID. And then we've got a recording of the whole thing. That's Twilio is doing it. What else do you have that's working? Do you use anything for landing pages for forms? Are you building it all yourself? Next JS like web framework just for everything. Mm hmm. My like macro thesis. For the stuff. This is a little out there and probably I'm probably going to say it badly. But like the notion of abstraction layers, I think are at risk from AI. So what do I mean by that? Whereas I'd, you'd just like use a SAS tool that does a certain thing to achieve a goal. Now I just asked the AI to build it from scratch. Mm hmm. And it's like, I'm not going to replace Slack with it or like Riverside, how we're setting this up right now, how we're like recording it. Certain things like that I would always use. But there's sort of a category of things that no longer make sense. What about Intercom? You're not using that for customer support? I do use Intercom because their library for the chat bit in the app works really well. That's non trivial to make that work. But I don't use their AI thing. And I answer many of the things that come in. I answer on a website that I built for myself. They hit their API just gets all the tickets and I just answered there because then I can kind of like layer on all my own stuff. I see. I didn't give any good examples for my pieces, but I'll think of them while we talk and I'll jump in it appropriately and say, oh, I just thought of it. Essentially what you're saying is where possible? I Josh like to build things myself instead of use these tools. And if I have to, I'm picking the tools that I need to, but I'm not using them all the way. I'd rather make my own and it's not that hard to make my own. That's right. Not as like a fetish, but as a like because it's actually better. What makes it better in your mind is like, it seems like you have a customized way for example for chat. You don't want them to start to figure out how to answer it in your place. You have a thesis on how to answer properly. Yeah, I'm trying to think of what a good example of this would be. Like, you know, a very basic example is like, if I'm going to send a big email, I don't need a like, wissy wig editor to set up the email. Like the AI will just build out the code like, Hey, I want to do an email about wave assistant, which is an email that went out this morning about chat across all of your, you know, across all of your sessions, smarter search in the app. That all just kind of rolled out. And it ended up, you know, that email was written by an AI. It's an HTML email, but I didn't use any like service for it. Um, it's actually actually make the email content because it's just easier to just do it in code. Anything that's sort of putting you that's sitting between you and the code is potentially going to just get in the way. You know, that's the thing that I'm noticing. Like really up and down the size of companies that I've talked to, they're trying now to just create it themselves. And it's not about cutting out costs. It's not, it's not that intercom costs too much. It's that they want more control over the experience. And that even goes down to a consultant company I talked with that's creating their own calendar because they need a little bits of customization to them. All right. That brings me to my sponsor. Zapier, I mentioned that they're a sponsor. You said, I'm integrating them somehow into customer service. What are you doing with Zapier then? I'm integrating them into a site that, you know, you recorded wave and then you either read it in the app or it'll send an email or you can share it to Google Docs or Notion. And I built out a bunch of the share features myself on the tools, you know, one node, Doc X, like Acrobat, like all the formats that someone would want. But I get in about all the time like, hey, I really would love for wave recordings to land in my companies like CRM. It's just like a so-tare thing that I never heard of. Do you have Zapier? And so I actually have a beta Zap or Zapier thing where once you set it up, every recording you do will trigger a Zap and it'll land that wherever you want. And it's part of a bunch of things I'm releasing in the next few weeks that include API access, MCP access. So if you want to ask one of the other AIs about your sessions, you can do that now. So it'll be API, MCP and Zapier are going to kind of roll on the same day as part of a like take your data wherever you want to go. I think there is value in being the app that facilitates making the data. So you're doing the recording, it's creating data. Everyone seems to like it for that. But it's like then what happens like the next stage is what you know something has to be action. We're meeting there's going to be some sort of output from that either a to do list or like action items or whatever or needs to land somewhere. We need or I say I need users to be able to get their data wherever they want as easily as possible. And so Zapier does a great job with that. They have the integrations with everything. So if you want to take your way sessions to some esoteric and that I never heard of, you can use Zapier for that. You know, I think the API access might be more useful, but for the non engineer Zapier is really the best. Yeah, I'm even finding the frankly if I use cloud code, it doesn't have enough connections out. And so what it'll say is just use Zapier and then get the connection you want. Just use the direct API. Here's the key. I mean, it's really like just one more story. I also use intercom for my dot for my like knowledge base like the articles about all the features. And my you know, I used to write them and really slave over them and make them better and use the ad help make them better. But now it's like, hey, cloud code. You see that feature in the code over there. Write, write the document about it and put it on intercom. And so now it's just like an AI is reading the code, understanding how the feature works as it's reading the code. Wow. Writing the writing the article in the style of the other articles that it can also read. And it's just like, I don't know man, it's crazy. No, it is incredible. And then it makes me wonder if everyone is going to be able to create or more people are going to be able to create. What does it mean? Does it mean that people are going to start creating their own version of wave? Does it mean that companies are going to start to do it or is it just that we'll always have both will have what we have now with SAS? And at the same time, people create their own software and addition. What do you think? I think there will be more software. So I mean, wave doesn't have to be a team of 50 people venture capital in an office. It's me in the downstairs apartment in my building. I think there'll be more. There'll be more software. I mean, I had to start in the shower. I recently, I'm in New York where we recently had a ton of snow. And I have young kids who I knew were going to want to sled. And I didn't currently have snow boots or pants for the snow. I left it upstate at my other house and I bought an Amazon like very cheap boots. You know, and they were great. They were like 40 bucks and they were great boots. The pants were similarly great. So I felt like 100 bucks on very, very useful things. And I wonder if software. It's like making a peril is like a solved problem. Like we know how to do that. We do it overseas. The supply chain is there. They make the boots really cheap and every size. They ship them. They go to Amazon. I pick the boots based on where I could get it the next day in my size. And I got them for really cheap. I sort of wonder if software might be similar and that it's cheap to make. There's a ton of it. None of it is huge. The boot brand is unknown. My kids and wife made fun of the way the boots looked. But boy, did they do the job? And so I wonder if software will have a similar kind of thing where there's just a lot of it. Keep there's a lot of options. Which one you use doesn't really matter. Like the boots are the boots. The AI recorder is the AI recorder. And you might have one that you like better. But at the end of the day, it's like they just do it. The like bears are so low that there could be many options for everything you want to do. And so to me, what I'm doing looks more like running a corner store. That I work in full time. And I sweep that at the end of the day myself. And I'm the shopkeeper and I lower the gate at the end of the day. And I'm like, that's more the mode that I'm in than like a high tech software company. Because I'm working alone. I do it to make money. This isn't an equity play. This is to make money now. As a business. I'm the business owner on the small business owner. So I'm always on. I'm always thinking about it. That's okay. That's what I want to do. That's what I like. And it's sort of more like that. I just work on the. I have a shop in cyber space, if you will. And I sell things to a small number of people relatively speaking. But it makes plenty for me and for my. Family like it covers everything. And so that's. That's more that's the mode. It's not a big company. So like what is AI, you know, allow anyone with. Agency can go and do something that's still a very small percentage of the population. It's still not most people. It's not everyone. It's not even most people. It's like a subset similar to who could do it before. You know, you don't have to be an engineer anymore. I feel like it's going to be a little bit like YouTube where before really good videos would only come on television and movies. And then eventually you end up with all these creators. And some of them are mysteries and some of them are doing it just for themselves because they like having family videos. And they're more creators. Okay. Do you think this could be a billion dollar business? Do you think this is the Sam Altman one person billion dollar business direction? Well, I can also answer this the way that I always do. Which is so I think that it's usually framed as one person unicorn and unicorn refers to a company worth, you know, the billion dollar mark. Not no one will ever value this because I'm not going to raise money. So there's no way for this to be a unicorn in that sense, which is a lot of vanity and kind of like what investors are willing to pay. It's a great signal for sure, but it's part of a scheme that I'm not part of right now. You know, I think what you're asking is like what is the natural limit of something run by one person. And I think it's probably quite a bit more than what I'm doing. I guess what I know I think the way I would put it like this before you're a runner. I love how on your website you show your latest run so beautifully done. Oh, thank you. Before I and you make me miss New York, I see that your last run was Central Park. Man, that's so good. I remember before I ran my first marathon, I met a marathoner and I said, how do you even do it? And you said the way you do it is you have to imagine that you're going to go more than a marathon. Do an ultra so that the marathon doesn't seem so big. It turns out that's not the way that I think. No, but it gave me a sense of the head space. What I eventually had to think was I'm going to run a marathon as a way of getting me to even run to 10k. I'm wondering do you have any number in your head that says, this is what I'm aiming for. Even if it means that I'm not going to run my version of a marathon and have a unicorn, I'm going to figure out what the 10k is that comes from that. What do you have in mind? Yeah, I mean, I think running, particularly someone who got into a late in life, I had no like high school running records. So like I'm in the last five years have run as well as I've ever run. You know, half marathon marathon as well as I've ever done not good in the sense of all runners, but good for Josh Moore. So, you know, it's related and then I sort of relish doing better than I've ever done in the past. And so I would like the I would like the numbers for this year, both on my running. And on the business to be best ever. Last year was best ever business, not best ever running. Those things are related. Unfortunately. And when it's 20 degrees outside, I can't do much running anyway, but I, I would just like it to grow. I think I have. Yeah, there's no grand vision. I mean, it's the seven last try and love it to do 10 this year. That would be great. I don't think I'll be able to do that though. Let's see what happens. I'm just kind of enjoying the process. I'm unlike venture back startups, which have been exclusively where I've worked for the last couple decades. And those situations to me feel very focused on an outcome, like Uber, especially. And I didn't join Uber, even knowing what employee equity was. Or like, I knew it was, but it wasn't the focus. It had been I probably wouldn't negotiate a better deal, but it was just sort of like, cool. And I get stopped, but like, this is cool because I get free rides. And on the boss of a small part of the store, those are the two things that I liked a lot. When you're focused on the equity, did it sort of like someday we'll do X and you do your map. I'm like, well, I own this much and we'll sell for this much and how much I make. And that's very nice. I'm not sure if you're a focused situation that I'm really not in right now. Right now, it's sort of like I'm running a business. I want to run it as well as possible. I'd like it to be bigger than it is now. But it's so that I can make more money now. Not so that my stock or I sell it someday. None of that is really in focus because I don't think it's a sellable business. And I think, you know, if you'd ask me right after Uber, what I want. A lot of us would say like, we want to like own a small SaaS business. I do that now. I looked at buying one. I almost bought one for like Jim equipment. I was going to buy this e-commerce business that made Jim equipment and selling them on their website and on Amazon and all this. And it's like, I really got it and do that. This is way more of my mode. It is so beautiful to watch it get built in public. Let's close it out with the last segment of this conversation, which is how are you getting customers? And I wonder if you could take me through like the first customers, which sounds like it was your friends who were willing to give you feedback. But then the next and the next and then what works for you? So right now it's Apple search ads and Google ads for iOS and Android respectively. And I haven't been able to get meta ads to work in more than a year every few months. I dip back in I spend a bunch and it fails. And there's a bunch of reasons for that. Competition. And my ads are stale. And I think most of those those are both symptoms of a larger issue, which is that I'm just not that interested in doing it. And every so often a few times a year, I'm bringing on a new agency. We'll get up and running. They're like, well for sure, be able to make this work because my metrics are pretty good. Like if someone installs, it's like a one in 10 that they're going to give me money. And that's like, I'm told is pretty high for this sort of thing. Like so I need more installs, you know, and so I'll do between 800 and and a thousand stalls a day. And I think a lot of that is coming from from App Store search. You know, on on the app store, I have a 4.9 star like 11,000 reviews. So it just comes across as trustworthy and on Android, it's getting up there, but not quite as good. So I there's got to be a word of mouth element that I'm not really measuring. There's got to be some natural search, the ads and the in those two places are probably helping. But it's mostly yeah, and then really good retention. I mean, well, actually not really good, but some kind of retention. So that most of the money that comes in every day is renewal money. You know, imagine that most people are, I know you've changed your flow. I've done some research on how you change your pricing. You've said in the past that it was too complicated or maybe it was like cloud as I was analyzing it said that you shifted from complicated simple. I imagine that most people are doing annual subscriptions with you, right? But that's where the majority of the revenue is anyway. It's where most of the revenue is in terms of like, I just looked at this. It's actually split a third to third weekly monthly and annual in terms of people. But in terms of dollars, it's obviously way more unannual. But like, yeah, I mean, what's so weird, there are some things about the app store that are just like the way things are. And I had never really done any work there before. I had been working for for app companies, but not app subscription companies. And the whole idea of an annual subscription still makes no sense to me. I would never buy it in an annals for any thing. Like, I don't know what I'm going to like in a year. I feel like monthly isn't the right thing. But it turns out people love their annuals. So I started focusing on that and their trials. I didn't like trials. Everyone loves their trials. All right. Because I think on annuals where you give right now a three day trial, no trial on, I don't know if you do weekly or monthly. I've been experimenting with it. I think that makes sense. People say I'm going to try it and get the free three days. Yeah. I mean, the three days was such a stupid decision. It should be seven days. Like the whole app is very like all the business, all the activity is during the week. You know, we'll do big recording days every week day. It's a snow day a little less. And it's like federal holiday a little less weekends are dead. And like, so seven days is a more natural like experience it for a full lap around the week in your job. And I think that's why I think it's like the change to I'm just a very little optimization of that stuff because I find it's so unpleasant to work on. Nothing wrong with it. It's my it's where I started. I did the marketing and ops. That was my job. Every job I've ever had has been in that sort of thing. But I just like there's so much more dopamine in making new things. So I just try to keep making you sense that in you. And you know what? I don't think it levels you did that. From what I'm seeing levels, you were more of an operations person. When I see you, I've heard you I've read you now so much. I've been intensely in your world. When I see you light up. You light up from customer service where most people want to throw up from it. You you get excited about the building of it. But yeah, now that I'm actually talking to you about marketing, I thought you'd be jazzed about it. You are not. No. Not just about the support either, but the support is the. The first line of defense. It's where I learn about bugs. It's where you know, you're hearing what people want. If you're not talking with users. And look, I know I'm supposed to like invite a bunch of users on to a zoom for half hour and like watch them use the app. I'm not giving that I just can't I can't see that. But the customer service is like, you know, that's where shit gets real. That's everyone who's had a problem. And that's a useful group to talk to. And on good days, that channel is very quiet. And on bad days, it's not very quiet. You know what I mean? What's the Microsoft tool that lets you see how people are using your app. You're not using something like that. Yeah, I am. I have. I have sentry that like reports every problem that anyone has, whether they know it or not. But like, you know, I have a sort of a circle of people that I know from the real world who I gave free access to forever. And one of them sent me a text last night. I was in bed. She used to work for me at Uber. And what time was this? I'm just looking at the text. 915 PM. I guess I hadn't seen the text until I was in bed. I get a lot of sleep, by the way. I was in bed.
