## GO-TO-MARKET

### Phase 1: First 3 Customers (Days 1-45)

**Strategy:** Pure founder sales. No ads. No App Store (yet).

| Week | Action | Target |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1-2 | Submit Shopify App Store app, scrape 50 complainers, build landing page | 0 paid |
| 3-4 | DM 10 complainers/day, post 3x/week in communities | 5 pilots, 50 waitlist |
| 5-6 | White-glove pilot support, push for conversion | 3 paid, 100 waitlist |

**Channels:**
- Cold DMs to Shopify sellers on Reddit/Twitter (complaining about bookkeeping)
- Reddit r/shopify, r/ecommerce — value-first, mention tool organically
- Facebook Groups — same approach

**Cold Start Solve:** Offer 3 founders FREE lifetime access for testimonials + case studies.

### Phase 2: Scale (Days 46-180)

**Strategy:** Shopify App Store + accountant partnerships

- **Shopify App Store:** 0% rev share under $1M! CAC $20-40 organic. Start approval now (4-6 weeks).
- **Accountant referrals:** 25% recurring rev share. They touch 10-50 sellers each.
- **WooCommerce:** Second platform (no gatekeeping).

## CONTENT STRATEGY

### What Converts
- Pain posts: "Spent 4 hours on inventory sync AGAIN today..."
- Before/after: Screenshot of messy spreadsheet → clean dashboard
- Time-saved: "This AI handles my returns in 12 seconds vs 15 min"
- Viral hook: "3 referrals = lifetime early-adopter pricing"

### 30-Day Waitlist Plan
| Week | Action | Goal |
|------|--------|------|
| 1 | Join 10 groups, provide value (no pitch) | Build cred |
| 2 | Post pain-point content, soft CTA | 25 waitlist |
| 3 | Launch referral program, DM warm leads | 60 waitlist |
| 4 | FOMO push ("47 spots left"), testimonials | 100 waitlist |

## RISKS & MITIGATIONS

| Distribution (incumbents own SMB) | Partner/embed, don't compete. Shopify App Store. |
| Trust (financial data to startup) | SOC2 Day 1, read-only insights first |
| Technical (money handling = lawsuits) | Start narrow (AR/AP only), expand after proving reliability |
| Competition (QuickBooks AI) | Niche-native beats feature-bolted. SMBs hate complexity. |
