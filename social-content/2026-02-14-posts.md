### Post 1 — Pain Point (Morning)
```
Ever spent 3 hours fighting with your property manager over a deposit?

Swiss landlords count on tenants not knowing the law.

RégieBot knows the law. And it doesn't get tired.

### Post 2 — Frustration Hook (Afternoon)
```
Things AI agents should handle so you don't have to:

• Disputing debt collection letters
• Tracking tax deductions
• Following up on unpaid invoices
• Scheduling meetings

We're building all of them.

### r/Switzerland
**Title:** Anyone else frustrated with Serafe/Billag exemption process?
**Body:**
Been trying to get an exemption for months. The forms are confusing, support is useless. Has anyone successfully navigated this? Thinking about building an AI agent to help people with this specific problem...

*(Soft pitch, gauge interest)*

### r/expats or r/SwissExpats
**Title:** Moving to Switzerland checklist — would an AI assistant help?
**Body:**
I'm working on a project to help expats with the administrative nightmare of moving to Switzerland (permits, insurance, registration, etc.). Would this be useful to you? What's the most painful part of the process?

### Post 1 — Founder Story
```
We're building AI agents that do the work humans hate.

Not chatbots. Not assistants. Agents.

The difference?
- Chatbots answer questions
- Assistants schedule meetings
- Agents actually complete tasks end-to-end

Our first 16 agents are live. Zero marketing spend. Pure word of mouth.

What repetitive task would you automate first?
