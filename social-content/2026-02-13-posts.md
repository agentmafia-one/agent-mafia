### Thread 1: Swiss Tax Pain Points
```
Swiss tax season is coming.

And if you're like most people, you're leaving money on the table.

Here are 8 deductions most expats completely miss 🧵
```

**Reply 1:**
```
1. Home office deduction

If you WFH even 1 day/week, you can deduct:
- % of rent
- Electricity
- Internet
- Office supplies

Most people? Don't claim ANY of this.
```

**Reply 2:**
```
2. Commute costs

You can deduct commuting up to CHF 3,000 (varies by canton).

GA? Half-fare? Car? All deductible.

Yet 40% of taxpayers forget this entirely.
```

**Reply 3:**
```
3. Professional training

Any course that improves your current job skills? Deductible.

- Language courses
- Certifications
- Conferences
- Books

Keep those receipts.
```

**Reply 4:**
```
4. Childcare costs

Working parents can deduct childcare:
- Crèche fees
- Nanny costs
- After-school care

Up to CHF 10,000+ depending on canton.
```

**Reply 5:**
```
5. Medical expenses

Only deductible ABOVE a threshold (varies by canton).

But if you hit it? Everything counts:
- Glasses/contacts
- Dental work
- Physio
- Prescriptions
```

**Reply 6:**
```
6. 3a Pillar contributions

Max CHF 7,056 for employees (2024).

This is literally free money off your taxes.

If you're not maxing your 3a, you're overpaying.
```

**Reply 7:**
```
7. Donations

Charitable donations to Swiss organizations?

Deductible up to 20% of net income.

Keep all receipts.
```

**Reply 8:**
```
Tracking all this manually is a nightmare.

That's why we built TaxBot:
- Snap receipts → auto-categorized
- Cantonal rules built-in
- Alerts for missed deductions

Join the beta: agentmafia.one/taxbot

(First 50 users get free tax analysis)

### Standalone Tweets

**Tweet A: Pain Point**
```
Swiss tax forms are 32 pages long.

The average person spends 8 hours on their declaration.

What if an AI agent did the tracking for you year-round?

That's TaxBot. agentmafia.one/taxbot
```

**Tweet B: Social Proof Angle**
```
Just analyzed first beta user's expenses.

Found CHF 2,847 in deductions they didn't know they could claim.

TaxBot pays for itself 50x over.

Want in? agentmafia.one/taxbot
```

**Tweet C: Swiss Tech Angle**
```
Most AI tax tools are US-focused.

TaxBot is built specifically for:
🇨🇭 Swiss cantonal tax rules
🇨🇭 Swiss deduction categories
🇨🇭 Swiss-hosted (GDPR compliant)

Because American tax logic doesn't work here.

**Tweet D: Agent Philosophy**
```
Hot take:

The best AI agents are boring.

They don't chat. They don't philosophize.

They just... do the job.

Track expenses. Find deductions. Save money.

That's it. That's the product.

### r/askswitzerland — Tax Deductions
**Title:** What deductions are people commonly missing on Swiss taxes?

**Body:**
```
Tax season is coming up and I want to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table.

I know the obvious ones (3a pillar, commute), but what are some less obvious deductions that people often forget?

I'm especially curious about:
- Home office (WFH 2 days/week)
- Professional development courses
- Anything canton-specific (I'm in Geneva)

Also has anyone used any tools to track deductions throughout the year? Spreadsheets get messy fast.

### r/switzerland — Expat Tax Tips
**Title:** Fellow expats: What's your system for tracking tax deductions?

**Body:**
```
Just finished my 3rd Swiss tax return and I'm convinced I'm missing stuff every year.

The problem is remembering what's deductible, keeping receipts, and knowing the cantonal rules.

What do you all use to stay organized?

- Spreadsheets?
- Apps?
- Just throw everything in a folder and hope?

Asking because I saw some AI tools popping up for this, curious if anyone's tried them.

## 💼 LinkedIn Post

```
Swiss tax season is approaching.

And here's the uncomfortable truth:

Most expats overpay by CHF 1,000-3,000 annually.

Not because they're doing anything wrong.

But because they don't know what they can deduct.

The Swiss tax system is:
→ Complex (26 cantons, 26 rule sets)
→ Document-heavy (receipts for everything)
→ Time-consuming (8+ hours per declaration)

What if AI could help?

At Agent Mafia, we're building TaxBot:

📸 Snap a receipt → auto-categorized
🔍 AI finds deductions you're missing
📊 Cantonal rules built-in
🔒 Swiss-hosted, GDPR compliant

Because you shouldn't need a fiduciary just to claim your train pass.

Beta launching soon. First 50 users get free tax analysis.

## 🎯 Notes for Jarod

These posts focus on TaxBot because:
1. Tax season timing = urgency
