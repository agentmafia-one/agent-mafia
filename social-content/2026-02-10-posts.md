### Thread 1: Pain Point - Brand Monitoring
```
You're building in public.

People are talking about your product.

And you have NO IDEA what they're saying.

Here's why that's killing your growth 🧵
```

**Reply 1:**
```
Most founders find out about mentions by accident.

A friend sends a screenshot.
Someone tags you 3 days later.
You discover a viral complaint... a week old.

By then? The damage is done.
```

**Reply 2:**
```
The problem isn't awareness.

The problem is TIME.

- Checking Twitter manually? 30 min/day
- Google Alerts? Delayed by hours
- Mention tools? $100+/month

What if an AI agent did it for $49/mo?
```

**Reply 3:**
```
WatchBot monitors your brand 24/7:

✅ X/Twitter mentions (including misspellings)
✅ Google/web mentions
✅ Telegram alerts in <15 min
✅ Daily digest summary

Swiss-hosted. $49/mo. First 50 get 30 days free.

### Thread 2: AI Agent Philosophy
```
Hot take: The future isn't ONE AI that does everything.

It's SPECIALIZED agents that do ONE thing extremely well.

Here's why 👇
```

**Reply 1:**
```
ChatGPT is a generalist.

It can:
- Write code
- Analyze data
- Draft emails
- Create images

But "can do everything" often means "does nothing exceptionally"
```

**Reply 2:**
```
Your bookkeeper doesn't also fix your plumbing.

Your lawyer doesn't also cut your hair.

So why expect ONE AI to handle:
- Your accounting
- Your legal docs
- Your customer support
- Your marketing?
```

**Reply 3:**
```
The Agent Mafia approach:

📊 BookBot → Shopify bookkeeping
🎯 LeadBot → Lead qualification
👁️ WatchBot → Brand monitoring
📄 ContractBot → Contract review

One agent. One job. Done right.

### Standalone Tweets

**Tweet A: Social Proof Hook**
```
We just shipped WatchBot to our first pilot client.

It found 161 mentions they didn't know about.

Some were praise. Some were complaints.

All were opportunities they were missing.

Want in? DM me "WATCHBOT"
```

**Tweet B: Problem Agitation**
```
Startup founders:

How much time do you spend checking:
- Twitter for mentions
- Google for reviews
- Reddit for complaints

What if you could get a Telegram alert within 15 minutes of any mention?

That's what WatchBot does. $49/mo.
```

**Tweet C: Swiss Angle**
```
Your brand monitoring tool doesn't need to be hosted in the US.

WatchBot: Swiss-hosted, GDPR-compliant, no data resale.

Same features. Better privacy. Lower price.

## 🔴 Reddit Posts

### r/startups
**Title:** Built an AI agent that monitors brand mentions 24/7 — looking for beta testers

**Body:**
```
Hey r/startups,

I got tired of manually checking Twitter, Google, and Reddit for mentions of my startup. Google Alerts was too slow. Mention.com was too expensive.

So I built WatchBot — an AI agent that:
- Monitors X/Twitter + Google 24/7
- Sends Telegram alerts within 15 minutes
- Compiles a daily digest
- Swiss-hosted (privacy matters)

Looking for 10 beta testers. You'd get:
- 30 days free
- Direct line to me for feedback
- Help shape the product

If you're interested, comment or DM me your startup name + what keywords you want monitored.

Happy to answer questions about how it works.

### r/SaaS
**Title:** Shipped a brand monitoring SaaS in 48 hours using AI — here's what I learned

**Body:**
```
Last week I decided to build a brand monitoring tool. Not because the market needed another one — but because the existing options were:

1. Google Alerts (free, but 24-48h delay)
2. Mention.com ($41/mo, limited)
3. Brand24 ($79/mo+)

I wanted something that:
- Alerts me within 15 minutes
- Integrates with Telegram (where I live)
- Doesn't cost enterprise pricing

**What I built:**
- Python monitoring script
- Twitter API + Google scraping
- Telegram bot for alerts
- Daily digest compilation

**Stack:**
- Python + asyncio
- snscrape for Twitter
- BeautifulSoup for Google
- Telegram Bot API
- Cron for scheduling

**Lessons:**
1. Start with one channel (I did Twitter first)
2. Deduplication is harder than monitoring
3. "15 minute alerting" is a real selling point

Currently running for my first pilot client. If you want early access, DM me.

Pricing: $49/mo unlimited keywords (vs $100+ for competitors)
```

### r/Entrepreneur
**Title:** Built 12 AI agent landing pages in 10 days — here's what's working

**Body:**
```
I'm running an experiment: Build specialized AI agents for specific problems.

Not general-purpose chatbots. Agents that do ONE thing well.

**Built so far:**
- BookBot (Shopify bookkeeping)
- WatchBot (brand monitoring)
- LeadBot (lead qualification)
- TaxBot (expense tracking)
- ContractBot (contract review)
- + 7 more

**What's working:**
- Specific pain points > generic AI
- Swiss-hosting is a differentiator
- $49-99/mo price point is sweet spot
- Telegram integration is killer for alerts

**What's not:**
- Cold outreach on Reddit (too spammy)
- Generic "AI agent" positioning (confusing)

Currently looking for pilot customers for WatchBot (brand monitoring).

Anyone here interested in testing? 30 days free, just need feedback.

## 💼 LinkedIn Post

```
The future of AI isn't one model that does everything.

It's specialized agents that do one thing exceptionally well.

Think about it:

Your accountant doesn't also do your legal work.
Your lawyer doesn't also manage your marketing.

So why expect ChatGPT to handle your:
→ Bookkeeping
→ Contract review
→ Lead qualification
→ Brand monitoring

At Agent Mafia, we're building the opposite:

📊 BookBot → Syncs Shopify to QuickBooks
👁️ WatchBot → Monitors brand mentions 24/7
🎯 LeadBot → Qualifies leads while you sleep
📄 ContractBot → Reviews contracts for red flags

One agent. One job. Done right.

Each costs less than an hour of human labor per month.

That's the future of work.
